            <p class="about_p">Hi, I’m Kaiya. I specialize in providing professional care for newborns and first-time mothers, with years of experience working in hospitals and schools. I am dedicated to creating a safe and nurturing environment for each child, while supporting parents with guidance, reassurance, and personalized care. My goal is to help families feel confident and cared for during these important early stages of life.</p>

From establishing daily routines to providing attentive care for newborns, I strive to make the transition into parenthood as smooth and stress-free as possible. My experience has taught me that every child is different, and I am committed to delivering care that respects their individuality while promoting healthy growth and development.</p>
